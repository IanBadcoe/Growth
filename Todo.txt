Asserts in VPolyhedron.AddFace
-> faces with very small area
--> merge near-identical points, losing neighbours/faces as a result?

Progressive build class:
-> keep outer D tet -> tagged as "uninteresting"
-> track D neighbours and whether "local" or not
-> also track whether "interesting"
--> only interesting ones form V cells
-> when need new interesting cell
--> if neighbour:
---> should already have uninteresting neighbour at that point
---> set interesting
---> fill out any missing neighbours with uninteresting new points
---> calculate VPoly
--> if not neighbour:
---> as above but will need to add central cell too
-> spatial subdivision
--> for sphere search?
--> other uses later?
--> R-tree?
-> neighbours currently found via tets, given we are on a grid could simplify that?
